# JuliaCon24 Workshop: Hands-on with Julia for HPC on GPUs and CPUs

Details: https://pretalx.com/juliacon2024/talk/NTQZJJ/

## NERSC Perlmutter access (Read ASAP!)

To get the most out of the workshop, you need to apply for a NERSC training account **before the workshop (as early as possible)**! The reason for this is that everyone who applies for an account has to be checked, which can take some time (between a few minutes and a week) depending on their personal background (e.g. nationality and affiliation).

**Please only apply for an account if you 1) have a workshop ticket and 2) really plan to participate in the JuliaCon 2024 workshop on Tuesday, July 9 in person!**

To apply for an account:
1. Go to https://iris.nersc.gov/train
2. Fill out the application form with your details and the training code from Carsten Bauer's email from XYZ announcing this workshop.
3. Iris will display your training account's login credials **only once**. **Take a screenshot of your login credials**, you will not be able to change or recover these after you close this tab!
4. You can start experimenting once you account has been approved. Your training account will be availabe from until July 14th. Accounts get deleted afterwards, so remember to **backup your data** before July 14th.
