# JuliaCon24 Workshop: Hands-on with Julia for HPC on GPUs and CPUs

Details: https://pretalx.com/juliacon2024/talk/NTQZJJ/

## NERSC Perlmutter access (Read ASAP!)

To get the most out of the workshop, you need to apply for a NERSC training account **before the workshop (as early as possible)**! The reason for this is that everyone who applies for an account has to be checked, which can take some time (between a few minutes and a week) depending on their personal background (e.g. nationality and affiliation).

**Please only apply for an account if you 1) have a workshop ticket and 2) really plan to participate in the JuliaCon 2024 workshop on Tuesday, July 9 in person!**

To apply for an account, go to https://iris.nersc.gov/train and fill out the form.
