# JuliaCon24 Workshop: Hands-on with Julia for HPC on GPUs and CPUs

Details: https://pretalx.com/juliacon2024/talk/NTQZJJ/

## Applying for NERSC Training Account (Urgent!)

To get the most out of the workshop, you need to apply for a NERSC training account **before the workshop (as early as possible)**! The reason for this is that everyone who applies for an account has to be checked, which can take some time (between a few minutes and a week) depending on their personal background (e.g. nationality and affiliation).

**Please only apply for an account if you 1) have a workshop ticket and 2) really plan to participate in the JuliaCon 2024 workshop on Tuesday, July 9 in person!**

### Sign up for an account

To apply for an account:
1. Go to https://iris.nersc.gov/train
2. Fill out the application form with your details and **use the training code that you've received by email**.
3. Iris will display your training account's login credials **only once**. **Take a screenshot of your login credials**, you will not be able to change or recover these after you close this tab!
4. You can already start experimenting once your account has been approved. Your training account will be availabe until July 14th. Accounts get deleted afterwards, so remember to **backup your data** before July 14th.

If you are facing any issues, please reach out to Carsten Bauer (crstnbr@gmail.com).
