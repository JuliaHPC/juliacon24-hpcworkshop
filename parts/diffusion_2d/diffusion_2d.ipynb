For any performance assessment, we should make sure to run the code for at least 1 second in order to ensure reliable results.\n",

    "$T_\\mathrm{eff}$ provides an idea on how far from the performance of memory copy only memory-bounded codes are, under various assumptions. Refer to [Räss et al. (2022)](https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-15-5757-2022) for details.\n",
