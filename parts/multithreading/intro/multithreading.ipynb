    "Julia implements **task-based multithreading**. In this paradigm, a task - e.g. a computational piece of a code - is marked for **parallel** execution on **any** of the available Julia threads. Julia's **dynamic scheduler** will automatically put the task on one of the threads and trigger the execution of the task on said thread.\n",

    "\n",
    "**Advantages:**\n",
    "* high-level abstraction\n",
    "* nestability / composability (especially important for libraries)\n",

    "* scheduling overhead\n",

    "  * **can get in the way when performance engineering** because\n",
    "    * scheduler has limited information (e.g. about the system topology)\n",
