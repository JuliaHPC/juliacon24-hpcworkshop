# VS Code Cheatsheet

## SSH â†’ Perlmutter

1) In VS Code, press `F1` and run the `Remote-SSH: Open SSH Host...` command.
   - If the command isn't available, make sure that [Remote - SSH extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-ssh) is installed (but it should be available out of the box).
2) Enter `trainXY@perlmutter.nersc.gov` (with `trainXY` replaced by your training account) and press enter.
3) In the popup input box, enter your password and press enter.

After a second or two, you should have VS Code running on a Perlmutter login node! ðŸŽ‰
