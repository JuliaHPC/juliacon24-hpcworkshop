* The files `cpunode.sh` and `gpunode.sh` can be used to get an interactive shell on a (full) CPU/GPU node on Perlmutter (e.g. `sh cpunode.sh`).
* The `perlmutter_cheatsheet.md` collects a bunch of useful information and commands for Perlmutter, like example job scripts.
* The folder `jupyter-kernel` is only for backup purposes and shouldn't be needed.
